# 📖 Hello Microverse <a name="about-project"></a>

In this project, I have set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. The goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices I've learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them! I will also get my first code review. This is also a process that will be used in all Microverse projects.
